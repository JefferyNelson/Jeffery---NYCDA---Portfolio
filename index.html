				Design as we know it will be, if it is not already, the most important driving force in this brave new world.The leaders of this free world will be the doers of this generation; they are the scientist, engineers, artists, designers, architects, and programmers. We believe we are in a golden age of design and as tool builders we are hardwired to experience and interact.Good design to us is a catalyst for telling the human story. At the intersection of art, commerce, technology, and science, design will allow us to create meaningful experiences.
